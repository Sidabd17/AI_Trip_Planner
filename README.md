## 💡 How It Works
User fills travel form — destination, dates, preferences.

AI (OpenAI / custom logic) generates itinerary plan per day.

Itinerary stored in Firebase in a map format:
```
itinerary: {
  day1: { plan: [...] },
  day2: { plan: [...] },
  ...
}
```

Frontend displays each day with time-slotted places, maps, etc.
